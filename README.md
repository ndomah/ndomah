# 👋 Hi there!
My experience at Welocalize and TELUS International includes optimizing ad delivery algorithms, improving search engine relevance, and enhancing user engagement through advanced data analysis. Skilled in Python, R, SQL, and data visualization tools like Tableau and Power BI, I’ve applied machine learning techniques across projects involving time series forecasting, NLP, and computer vision.

In bioinformatics, I’ve worked with large biological datasets, such as RNA sequencing and gene expression analysis, using tools like Biopython, Seurat, and DESeq2. I’m proficient in cloud platforms (Azure, AWS, GCP) and have contributed to both AI model development and bioinformatics research.

With expertise across both fields, I am seeking opportunities that allow me to leverage my skills in data science/bioinformatics to drive innovation, research, and data-driven decision-making.
