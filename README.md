# 👋Hi there!
I’m a Data Engineer/Analyst with hands-on experience building scalable data pipelines in AWS, Azure, and real-time streaming platforms. Proficient in Python, SQL, and a range of modern data analytics, science, and engineering tools. I thrive on delivering actionable insights and optimized workflows to help organizations make informed decisions. I’ve honed my expertise through professional roles and personal projects, continuously upskilling by writing technical blog posts and pursuing a remote part-time MS in Computer Science. 

Whether it’s orchestrating end-to-end data solutions, designing dashboards for decision-makers, or architecting real-time pipelines, I’m driven by a passion for turning raw data into tangible value. I’m excited to leverage my growing skill set and collaborate on innovative projects that impact both business outcomes and the broader data community.
